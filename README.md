# Tubsey.github.io

1. Zachary Taylor - ztaylor2@my.waketech.edu
2. My github account is named Tubsey and I have used it before for a few projects. I worked on a game called Apoc Cleaner and another game called Duffy The Gryphon.
3. This repository will be used for future projects in this CTI 110.0001 class. This repository has the name Tubsey.github.io, and will be used to make a Github Pages website.
4. I had less steps overall as I already had this account made and Github Desktop installed. The steps I took were:
    logging into my account on Github.com.
    clicking the + icon and selecting "New Repository".
    Filling in the repository name, selecting Public, checking the box to add a README file, and clicking create repository.
    Open Github Desktop, click on the + icon and clone a repository, then click the one I just created.
    I already have a github folder on my computer under Documents, so I cloned the repository to it.
